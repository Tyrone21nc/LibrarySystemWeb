Library System Web

Description:
This project is the web version of an online library system. I drew inspiration from a [previous project](https://github.com/Tyrone21nc/Library-System) 
I worked on a little under a year ago using C++. This web manifestation of this library system allows for the simple features. Unlike the C++ version, 
this version allows for two features:
  1. displaying
  2. search and displaying
