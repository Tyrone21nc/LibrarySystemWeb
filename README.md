## Description:
This project is the web version of an online library system. I drew inspiration from a [previous project](https://github.com/Tyrone21nc/Library-System) 
I worked on a little under a year ago using C++. This web manifestation of this library system allows for the simple features. Unlike the C++ version, 
this version allows for two features:
  1. display
  2. search and display

## Features Explained
### Display
When you open the site, you will notice a **"Display Books"** button on the left hand side of the page.
- When you click it the first time, all 900+ books will be displayed and the button will now say
     **"Clear Books"** with a change of background and text coloring.
- When you click the button now, it will also undergo another background and text coloring and go back
     to saying, **"Display Books"**

### Search and Display
To search by an author (**author**), book title (**title**), book year published (**year**), or even book rating (**rating**), we can use the search options at the top of the page.
- To search by author, you input the author's name in the first search box and type "**author**" in the second search box.
      To now display the search results, press the search icon for the first search box then the search icon for the second box in that order
- You do this for every search type. You want to search by title, enter the title and type title, then press the first **then** the second search icon, then the results will apear below
